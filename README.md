# Python 
📁 Python Practice (From Basics to Advanced)
This repository contains my Python practice journey, based on the complete tutorial series by Code With Harry. It includes all important concepts from the beginner to intermediate level, implemented and tested using VS Code.

🧠 Topics Covered:
📥 Input and Output:

Using input() and print() for user interaction

Type conversion (int(), float())

🔀 Conditional Statements:

if, else, elif conditions

Logical operators (and, or, not)

Relational operators and use-cases like grade system, age verification

🔁 Loops:

while and for loops

Using break, continue, and pass statements

Looping over lists and ranges

Loop-based tasks: checking for prime numbers, printing tables, filtering values

📦 Data Structures:

Lists: Creation, indexing, iteration

Tuples: Immutable sequences

Sets: Unique elements, set operations

Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, accessing and modifying data

🧮 Functions:

Defining and calling functions

Function arguments and default values

Return statements for reusable logic

Practical examples like average of three numbers

🔁 Recursion:

Concept of recursion in Python

Simple recursive function examples

📂 File Handling:

Reading from and writing to files using open()

Modes: r, w, a

Practical examples with file.txt

🧰 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Creating classes and objects

Using constructors (__init__)

Inheritance and method overriding

File: oops.py, inheritance.py

🛠️ Projects & Practice Scripts:

Small logic-building scripts (project1.py)

Task-specific practice files with examples
